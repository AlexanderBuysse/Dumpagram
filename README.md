# Dumpagram 2020
This is a school project where we had to make a social media clone with PHP and PHPmyadmin. 
We had to use our own database and make the connection on our own. 

In the project we had to upload images, search for images via a search word.
You can give three different reactions to the photos and limitless commenting. 
It must also be possible to add things to your database with javascript.
